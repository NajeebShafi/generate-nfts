## Usage ‚ÑπÔ∏è

Create your different layers as folders in the 'assets' directory, and add all the layer assets in these directories. You can name the assets anything as long as it has a rarity weight attached in the file name like so: `example element#70.png`.

Once you have all your layers, go into `config.json` and update the `layer` objects `layers` array to be your layer folders name in order of the back layer to the front layer.

_Example:_ If you were creating a portrait design, you might have a background, then a head, a mouth, eyes, eyewear, and then headwear, so your `layersOrder` would look something like this:

```json
{
  "layers" : [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "background",
      "directory": "Background"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "face_color",
      "directory": "Face Color"
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "name": "face_shape",
      "directory": "Face Shape"
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "name": "eye_color",
      "directory": "Eye Color"
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "name": "eye_shape",
      "directory": "Eye Shape"
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "name": "nose",
      "directory": "Nose"
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "name": "lips",
      "directory": "Lips"
    }
  ]
}
```

The `directory` of each layer object represents the name of the folder (in `/assets/`) that the images reside in.

The program will output all the images in the `output/{you-config-file-name}` directory. i am still working on metadata creation.
